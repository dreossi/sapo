## TODO
 - [X] Remove all the memory leaks
 - [ ] Add real support to brew
 - [ ] Check whether it is possible to move from vector to list in both LinearSystemSet and Flowpipe.
 - [ ] Add an option to select whether the synthesize method should end as soons as it finds a non-null sets of parameters or keep splitting the parameter sets up to the maximum number of splits.
 - [ ] Parallel computation for the evolution of bundle sets (have a look at https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/thread, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/shared_mutex, https://stackoverflow.com/a/10673671, and https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/hardware_concurrency). 
 - [X] Add constructors and swap functions for the copy-swap semantics.
 - [ ] Remove BaseConverter class and turn its methods in proper functions.
 - [ ] Introduce a namespace for Sapo.
 - [ ] Improve code documentation (Doxygen?).
 - [ ] Review all the code.
 - [ ] Write a method to test whether a LinearSystem is fully included in a LinearSystemSet. At the moment, we have a method that tests whether one of the LinearSystems of the LinearSystemSet fully includes the LinearSystem.
 - [ ] Use a proper class in place of std::vector<std::vector<double> > for matrices and std::vector<double> for vectors.
 - [X] Add both a LinearSystemSet::const_iterator and an LinearSystemSet::interator classes
 - [ ] Parallel computation for Bundle::{transform, decompose} (OpenMP? Cuda?)
