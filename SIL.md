# SIL

Sapo Input Language (SIL) is a language designed to provide an input model for Sapo.
It is divided in

- [Header](#header)
- [Symbol definitions](#symdef)
- [Matrices defnition](#matdef)
- [Footer](#footer)

## <a name="header">Header
It consists in

### problem definition (required)

```C++
problem: reachability | synthesis;
```

### variable modality (optional)

```C++
variable_mode: boxes (default) | parallelotopes | polytopes;
```

### parameter modality (optional)

```C++
parameter_mode: boxes (default) | parallelotopes;
```

### number of iterations (required)

```C++
iterations: num;
```

### maximum number of parameter splits (optional)

```C++
max_parameter_splits: num;
```

When parameter synthesis returns an empty set, the result may be due to over-approximation. 
Since the approximation also directly depends on the size of the parameter set, in order to decrease it, 
the initial parameter set can be split in subsets and the computation can be repeated for each them.
The `max_parameter_splits` option declares the maximum number of splits that Sapo can perform 
searching for a non-empty set satisfying the specification.

## <a name="symdef">Symbol definitions

In this section, we define variables with dynamics, parameters, constants and the specification (if required).
Each symbol must be defined before it is used.

### Variables
If the variable modality is `boxes`, they are defined with the initial values

```C++
var v in [a,b];
```
Otherwise, just the name is provided. Multiple variables can be defined in the same command.

```C++
var v1, v2;
```
Variable names follow the C++ rule for identifiers.

### Parameters

They follow the syntax of variable definition. If parameter modality is `boxes`, they require the initial interval.

```C++
param p1, p2 in [0.01, 0.02];
```

Otherwise, no interval must be provided

```C++
param p1;
```

### Constants
They define a map between identifiers and numerical values.
The usual rules hold for constant names, and the corresponding expression must be numeric only.

```C++
const c1 = 1.2;
const c2 = 34 * 0.78;
```

### Dynamics
They represent the evolution of variables with resect to time.

```C++
dynamic(v1) = v1 + p * (v2 - c + v3);
```
where

- `v1` is a name of an already defined variable
- all symbols occurring in the expression must be already defined
- the expression must be linear with regard to parameters
- the expression must be polynomial with respect to the variables

Each variable must have a corresponding dynamic defined.

### Specification
If problem is `synthesis`, a STL specification must be provided.

+ An atomic formula is of the form
	
	```C++
	ex1 ~ ex2
	```
	where

	- `ex1` and `ex2` are expression involving numbers, variables and constants
	- `~` is one of `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` or `=` 

+ Negation is written
	
	```C++
	! f
	```

+ Conjunction is written
	
	```C++
	f1 && f2
	```

+ Disjunction is written
	
	```C++
	f1 || f2
	```

+ Until is written
	
	```C++
	f1 U[a,b] f2
	```
	
	This formula holds at time `t` if there exists a time point `t'` in `[t+a, t+b]` such that `f2` hlds at time `t'` and `f1` hold in all time points from `t` to `t'`.

+ Eventually is written
	
	```C++
	F[a,b] f
	```
	
	This means that there exists a point in `[t+a, t+b]` where `f` holds.

+ Globally is written
	
	```C++
	G[a,b] f
	```
	
	This means that at all time points in '[t+a, t+b]` the formula `f` holds

Finally, the specification is provided as

```C++
spec: STLformula;
```

## <a name="matdef">Matrices definition
In this section, we provide the definition of the polytopes used to approximate reachable sets and parameters.

### Variables
If variable modality is `boxes`, no matrix must be defined.
If variable modality is `parallelotopes`, then we must define the direction matrix.
That is, for each direction we write

```C++
direction <num_1, ..., num_n> in [a, b];
```
We have as many elements in a direction as the number of variables.
The meaning is

```C++
a <= num_1*v_1 + ... + num_n * v_n <= b
```
We must provide as many directions as the number ov variables, paying attention to defined a bounded set.

If variable modality is `polytopes`, then we must define a set of directions as described above.
This time we can provide a number of directions which is higher than the number of variables.
Then, we define the *template matrix* in which each row represents a parallelotope.

```C++
template = {
	{num_1, ..., num_n},
	.
	.
	.
	{num_1, ..., num_n}
}
```
where each row has as many elements as the number of variables, and each value corresponds to a direction.
For example, number `0` is the first direction (in order of definition), `1` is the second and so on.
The template matrix can have any number of rows (at least one).

### Parameters
They work similarly to the variables.
If parameter modality is `boxes`, no matrix is required.
Otherwise, we must provide the directions for parameter parallelotope.

```C++
parameter_direction <num_1, ..., num_m> in [a, b];
```
where there is a number for each parameter, and the meaning is

```C++
a <= num_1 * p_1 + ... + num_n * p_m <= b
```

We recall that parameter modality cannot be `polytopes`.

## <a name="footer">Footer
In this section, we can provide some options to tune the behavior of Sapo.
All them are optional, so this section can be empty.

We can define
- how we compute the image of a polytope (optional)
	
	```option transformation AFO (default) | OFO;```
	In general, `AFO` gives more accurate results but `OFO` is faster.

- whether or not to perform an optional decomposition phase after computing set images.
	
	```option decomposition;```

- set a weigth `alpha` in `[0,1]` used in decomposition, to define the importance given to polytope volume over maximum side length in the cost function
	
	``` option sapo_alpha num;```

## Comments
SIL understands C/C++ like comments, both sigle and multi-line

```C++
...
// single line comment
...
/*
multi-line
comment
*/
...
```
